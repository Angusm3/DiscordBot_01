alarak's masteries aren't garbage
well it's not like i was watching many cartoons anyway.
a.) i don't like the writing in naruto. i couldn't get past a few episodes before i gave up on that show.
b.) i'm currently in the midst of a bit of writer's block. i've been wanting to make a comic since forever, but i want to have at least a decent idea of how the whole story unfolds from beginning to end, since i don't want this to be one of those "pull stuff out of my ass as i go and things begin to make less sense as time goes on" things (cough inuyasha cough). got stuck right after issue 3.
the whole comic starts with the main character not knowing his own identity, trying to find it and giving up, then several years later accidentally awakens a new power which rekindles his search. issue 2 introduces a mysterious organization of antagonists, and issue 3 fleshes it out just a bit by giving them a name (the greywolves) and ends with them learning of gier's whereabouts and hunting him down (for, currently, an unknown reason).
post this point i was having a hard time moving the story forward, mostly on account of having no actual idea where gier should even begin to look for clues about his past.
so fast forward to me being bored out of my skull and watching a compilation of fight scenes from naruto. as one character is facing off against an entire clan, i kinda realized something that's almost cliche for that genre - a group setting up an ambush for someone. it's cliche but i could move the story forward with something like that - if, somehow, a bit of information is "conveniently" conveyed to gier which lures him away from bastion city to a smaller town (to reduce the chance of unwanted attention - bastion city's pretty densely populated). and there, or on the way there, they attack him. haven't quite figured out where that goes or how i should use it to drive the plot, but it should be a pretty good start.
you know what else is a cliche? starting a story with a character with no memory of their past while their first question is "who am i?". it's basically starting a blank slate with no history. i've heard of two games that use this; one's dust, the other is some blonde girl that controls gravity (forgot the name of that other game). but this is the fifth time i hear someone suggesting they write their character like this in the beginning.
let's not forget second sight
@killamaaki how about the organisation attack his house? basically the protagonist is a threat to them because he knows something  that he himself doesn't know, so they wanna find and kill him as soon as they can.
@angus i thought about it, but didn't end up applying
@time travl he doesn't know
one thing is it's now about what he knows, it's more what he's capable of. and taking him on in the city isn't as desirable as luring him away - each time they've fought, they attracted the attention of police in the city. so luring him somewhere more remote and secluded would make things a lot easier for them. also he basically lives in an apartment, so attacking him there attracts even more attention (can you imagine the noise complaints for a couple of characters with special powers going all out? lol)
there was this one moment where i was staring at the spinning wheel in the lower right corner of unity which shows you that it's compiling code, and i was thinking to myself "oh my god this is taking forever, why is it taking so long? it doesn't usually take this long!". cue a little bit later, i realized it was just me and it compiled just as quickly as it normally does lol.
don't ignore me
nope, not even a random quote.
don't be like that, angus.
i changed no code
are you gonna fukken break again for no reason
no you're not allowed to have a character that uses dnd 1e, 2e, and 3e rules
no no
certainly not vanilla 1e, 2e, or 3e
